# Weather API Application

This is a Flask web application that allows users to get current weather information for a specified city, as well as compare the weather between two cities. It retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Current Weather Data:** Users can enter a city name to get current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times.
- **City Comparison:** Users can compare the weather of two cities side by side.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple forms for input and results displayed in an organized manner.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** For retrieving weather data.
- **HTML/CSS:** For front-end templates and styling.
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables.

   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
     ```env
     API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
     ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.
